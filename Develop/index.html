            <p>
                I can admit my limitations, but I can also admit my endless passion for the things that I love. When it comes to coding, yes I am quite new and have yet to tackle my biggest obstacles. But the opportunity laid before me is a good one. <br>
                    
                <br>I believe that with my drive and grit, I can learn and tackle any problems that come my way. It may take a while and I don't promise to solve them perfectly, but what I can promise is trying and improving myself every day. Thanks for giving me a shot.

                Welcome to my PP page. Jokes aside, I am very happy you took the time to visit! My name is Arseniy Vorobei and I am a business-major-musician-turned-computer-whiz going on this amazing journey of computer programming! So far, I have pretty elementary skills and no real experience with many different proramming languages but I am learning every day and I will take the time to learn what I need to be successful in this fast-paced industry. So, since I cannot leverage my yet-to-be-acquired computer skills, what can I offer today?
                My biggest strengths listed are: creativity and an 'always learning' attitude, my ability to take criticism and put forth a plan of improvment which is at once efficient and effective, and my determination and initiative. Oh and I take great pride in my work so I can safely say that I may not only put my best work forward, but also incessantly and obessively try to improve it afterwords. Sounds awful but hear me out;

                  <p>This project allowed one to observe a codebase whose accessibility standards were followed and optimized esepcially for search engines. When the source code, structure of the HTML, title, image elements and heading attributes were viewed, then semantic elements were found which followed a logical structure, with all alt and heading attributes falling in sequential order.</p>
